This program uses a dataset with photos of cats and dogs. Based on a trained Mobile Net neural network, this neural network is able to determine which of the two animals is in the image with 99% accuracy.

What is MobileNet?
MobileNet is a computer vision model open-sourced by Google and designed for training classifiers. It uses depthwise convolutions to significantly reduce the number of parameters compared to other networks, resulting in a lightweight deep neural network.
